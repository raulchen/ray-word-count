The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the most significant disruption[1] to the worldwide sporting calendar since World War II. Across the world and to varying degrees, sports events have been cancelled or postponed.[2][3][4] The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were rescheduled to 2021.[5] Spectators have no games to watch and players no games to play.[6] Only a few countries and territories, such as Hong Kong,[7] Turkmenistan,[8] Belarus, and Nicaragua, have continued professional sporting matches as planned.[9]

International multi-sport events
Summer Olympics

The 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were scheduled to take place in Tokyo starting 24 July. Although the Japanese government had taken extra precautions to help minimize the outbreak's impact in the country,[10][11] qualifying events were being canceled or postponed almost daily. "And the Games themselves are expected to draw 600,000 foreign visitors from nearly every country. According to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, Tokyo 2020 organizing-committee chief executive Toshiro Muto voiced concerns on Feb. 5 that COVID-19 might "throw cold water on the momentum toward the Games."[12][13]

The traditional Olympic flame lighting ceremony in Olympia, Greece, to mark the start of the 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay was held on 12 March without spectators.[14] On 23 March, Canada, Australia, and Great Britain announced that they would withdraw from the Games unless they are postponed for one year.[15] On 24 March 2020, the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee announced that the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics would be "rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021", marking the first time in the history of the modern Olympics that an Olympiad has been postponed.[16][17][18] The opening ceremonies of the Games were officially rescheduled to 23 July 2021.[19]

On 29 April 2020, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned that the Games "must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic".[20] He also says that if a vaccine is not found, the Olympics will be canceled completely.
Winter Olympics

Although the next Winter Olympics are not until 2022 (hosted by Beijing, China), the pandemic has already impacted qualifying in specific sports such as curling—where the World Curling Federation announced a proposal to have qualification be dependent on performance in the 2021 world championships (whose top teams will automatically qualify) and a final qualification tournament, as opposed to the previous plan of having qualification determined by both the 2020 and 2021 world championships.[21] Qualification for the women's hockey tournament was to be determined by IIHF World Rankings after the 2020 Women's World Championship. As the tournament was cancelled, the existing rankings going into the tournament were used instead.[22]
World Games

The World Games in Birmingham, Alabama, were scheduled for July 2021, but due to the rescheduling of the 2020 Summer Olympics, the eleventh World Games will be held in July 2022 instead.[23]
Arctic Winter Games

The 2020 Arctic Winter Games were cancelled.[24]

National amateur multi-sport governing-body competitions
Canada

U Sports curtailed its men's and women's ice hockey championships on 12 March. On 8 June 2020, U Sports announced that it had cancelled all national championships for the fall semester of the 2020–21 academic year, including football (the first time the Vanier Cup will not be contested since its inception), cross-country, field hockey, women's rugby, and soccer.[26] Atlantic University Sport, Canada West, and Ontario University Athletics followed suit, suspending all university athletics programs through the end of 2020.[27][28][29][30]
Ireland

The Gaelic games of football, hurling, camogie, and ladies' football – mostly played in Ireland – saw all competitions suspended from 12 March 2020. The National Hurling League, National Football League, National Camogie League and Ladies' National Football League were suspended, with competitions not intended to resume until 29 March at the earliest.[31][32] On 17 March, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) confirmed that the opening fixture of the 2020 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship – due to have taken place at Gaelic Park in The Bronx on 3 May – had been postponed.[33]

On 26 June all GAA competitions would commence in October, with the hurling and football competitions to be an all-knockout competition.
Philippines

In the Philippines, NCAA Season 95 and UAAP Season 82 were both indefinitely suspended.[34][35] NCAA Season 95 was terminated on 19 March after the then community quarantine in Luzon was upgraded to an "enhanced community quarantine", in effect a lockdown.[36] UAAP Season 82 was canceled on 7 April, after the enhanced community quarantine was extended to 30 April.[37]

On 1 May, the Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation, Inc. (CESAFI) have decided to cancel their 2020 season.[38]
United Kingdom

On 16 March 2020, British Universities and Colleges Sport, the UK organisation for university sport, announced that all fixtures from 17 March to 1 April would not take place. Some individual events, like the orienteering and windsurfing championships were canceled entirely, while others were postponed indefinitely.[39]
United States

On 11 March 2020, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) — the main U.S. sanctioning body for college athletics — initially announced that its winter-semester championships and tournaments, including its popular "March Madness" men's basketball tournament, would be conducted behind closed doors with "only essential staff and limited family attendance".[40]

The following day, in respect of the suspension of the NBA season and other professional sports leagues, the NCAA announced that all remaining championship events for the 2019–20 academic year would be canceled entirely, resulting in the first cancellation in the 81-year history of the NCAA basketball tournament.[41] This created a de facto mythical national championship situation.[42] Other American multi-sports organizations—the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA),[43] National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA),[44] and California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA)[45]—also canceled their seasons. Additionally the Community College level sports governing bodies restored the season of eligibility to athletes who had already participated in the 2020 spring season.

On 12 May, due to the California State University system announcing that in-person classes would remain suspended through the fall 2020 semester, the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA)—a 12-member NCAA Division II conference consisting entirely of CSU campuses[a]—announced that it would also suspend its fall athletics season.[47]

The Patriot League, an NCAA Division I conference that competes in the second level of D-I football,[b] the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), initially announced on 22 June that while it would hold its fall sports seasons, its teams would not fly to any competitions, and overnight travel would only be allowed on a case-by-case basis.[48] Another FCS conference, the Ivy League, announced on 8 July that it was canceling all fall sports, and that winter sports (whose seasons normally begin during the fall academic term) would not begin play until after the end of the fall term. It left open the possibility of shifting its fall sports, including football, to the spring.[49] The Patriot League would later cancel its fall sports season entirely on 13 July, but gave the two federally operated service academies among its membership, Army and Navy, the option to play fall sports as they saw fit. While the academies are full members of the Patriot League, their football teams play outside the conference in the top-level Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS).[50]

The days following the Ivy League's cancellation of fall sports saw two of the major "Power Five" conferences of FBS announce that if fall sports were played, only in-conference matchups would take place. The Big Ten Conference made this announcement on 9 July,[51] with the Pac-12 Conference doing the same the next day.[52]

The financial fallout from the pandemic was specifically cited by the following schools in their decisions to drop certain sports programs. Unless otherwise noted, all announcements were effective for the 2020–21 school year.

At levels below the fully professional AFL, most leagues either cancelled their entire season[109] or significantly delayed their start.[110] Player payments were cut to zero in the South Australian National Football League.[111]

The 2020 AFL season has since resumed, however most games are or have been played without crowds. The league also reduced playing time by 20%, to four 16-minute quarters instead of 20-minute quarters. Other smaller changes have also been added due to the pandemic.

The AFL then relocated all games scheduled for Victoria to other states for that week and the following week.[112] Then, on 15 July, the AFL announced that all teams based in Victoria would relocate to either Queensland or Western Australia for the rest of the season. This came due to Victoria ordering a six-week lockdown to deal with a surge in cases.[113]

In regards to its next pay-per-view, UFC 249 on 18 April, UFC president Dana White stated that the event would likely go on, but at a new venue behind closed doors. It was originally to be held at New York City's Barclays Center, but a stay-at-home order was issued by the New York state government.[213] On 18 March, the New York State Athletic Commission also withdrew its sanctioning for the event.[214] Due to international travel restrictions and other withdrawals, a revised card for UFC 249 was unveiled 6 April with a location still being determined.[215][216] On 7 April, White disclosed that he had booked an unspecified venue for two months, in order to host both UFC 249 and other future events involving U.S. fighters. He also disclosed plans to secure a private island to host events with international fighters.[217][218]

The new UFC 249 venue was subsequently revealed to be Tachi Palace—a tribal casino in Lemoore, California; as it is on tribal land, it also fell outside of the jurisdiction of the California State Athletic Commission, meaning that events held there could be self-sanctioned.[214] On 9 April, UFC announced that UFC 249 had been canceled, and all other UFC events would be suspended until further notice. White cited interventions from high-ranking staff of the UFC's U.S. media rightsholders, ESPN Inc. and parent The Walt Disney Company.[219] The New York Post reported that Governor of California Gavin Newsom had contacted Disney chairman and former CEO Bob Iger, urging ESPN and the UFC to not hold the event.[220] Despite the cancellation, White stated that he was still going on with his "Fight Island" project.[219][220]

The UFC later announced on 24 April that it would resume its events with a series of three cards held behind closed doors at the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, Florida, beginning with UFC 249 on 9 May, along with two other cards on 13 May (UFC Fight Night: Smith vs. Teixeira) and 16 May (UFC on ESPN: Overeem vs. Harris). Florida had recently exempted sporting events held behind closed doors for a national audience from its stay-at-home order. White also announced a planned card at an undetermined location on 23 May, and plans to begin events at his "Fight Island" in June.[221] The Nevada Athletic Commission approved the hosting of UFC on ESPN: Woodley vs. Burns on 30 May, and UFC 250 on 6 June, both at the company's UFC Apex facility in Las Vegas.[222][223]

On 9 June, White revealed that the "Fight Island" venue was Yas Island in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, which hosted UFC 251 on 11 July and will host three other UFC Fight Night cards. The area includes accommodations and training facilities, and a 10-square-mile (26 km2) area restricted to fighters, coaches, and UFC staff.[224]

In accordance with recommendations from the Japanese Ministry of Health, New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) decided to cancel all scheduled shows from 1 March through 15 March.[235] On 10 March, NJPW announced that they were cancelling all shows through 22 March, which meant that they cancelled the 2020 New Japan Cup as well.[236] The Stardom promotion, sister company of NJPW also owned by Bushiroad, also made adjustments to their scheduled, cancelling shows from 19 February to 14 March. Their 8 March show in Korakuen Hall was held without any spectators in attendance, instead streaming live on their YouTube channel.[237] On 23 March, NJPW would later cancel the 2020 Sakura Genesis event that was originally scheduled to take place in on 31 March.[238][239] On 8 April, NJPW would cancel more events from 11 April through 4 May, which mean both nights of 2020 Wrestling Dontaku were cancelled as well.[240] On 6 May, NJPW cancelled their annual Best of the Super Juniors tournament.[241] The next day, NJPW postponed their Wrestle Dynasty event to 2021, which was to take place in Madison Square Garden in New York.[242] On 9 June, NJPW announced their return with special show with mystery match card called Together Special on 15 June and the return of the New Japan Cup would now be held from 16 June until 11 July, with the finals being held at Osaka-jō Hall in Osaka alongside Dominion in Osaka-jo Hall being rescheduled to 12 July 2020.[243][244]
WWE

American promotion WWE began to move the broadcasts of its weekly programs SmackDown and Raw (which usually broadcast from arenas) behind closed doors to its Orlando training facility, the WWE Performance Center, beginning with SmackDown on 13 March, with no audience and only essential staff in attendance.[245][246][247] The promotion also postponed some of its upcoming house shows.[248]

WrestleMania 36—WWE's flagship pay-per-view event—was originally scheduled to be held at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. On 16 March, WWE announced that it would also be produced from the Performance Center and air across two nights (4 and 5 April).[249][250][251] WrestleMania Weekend's associated events, such as the NXT TakeOver: Tampa Bay card (which was scheduled for Amalie Arena) and WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony were also postponed to unannounced dates, though TakeOver was ultimately canceled with its planned matches moved to weekly episodes of NXT.[252] Matches for WrestleMania, as well as the final two episodes of SmackDown and final episode of Raw before WrestleMania, were recorded in advance at the Performance Center between 21 and 26 March.[253] While the majority of matches were filmed in Performance Center arena and presented plausibly live, two matches were filmed off-site in different, cinematic styles.[254][255][256]

After continuing with pre-taped episodes for the go-home shows after WrestleMania, WWE announced that its weekly series would resume live broadcasts on 13 April, with Raw and SmackDown from the Performance Center as before, and NXT from its existing studio at Full Sail University in Winter Park.[257][258] WWE told ESPN that "it is now more important than ever to provide people with a diversion from these hard times", and that its programming "bring[s] families together and deliver a sense of hope, determination and perseverance".[258] WWE also confirmed that one of its employees had contracted COVID-19 after a meeting with two health care workers on 26 March, but that the exposure occurred after production had wrapped; the employee had not made any contact with WWE staff since and they made a complete recovery.[258][259][260] Wrestling journalists Dave Meltzer noted that WWE's television contracts with Fox and USA Network likely restricted the number of non-live episodes it could broadcast per-year (accommodating breaks in live broadcasts usually held around the Christmas and New Year holidays).[261]

WWE's next PPV, Money in the Bank, was expected to be held at Baltimore's Royal Farms Arena in May, but was canceled by the arena on 9 April.[262][263] On 17 April, WWE announced that the show's eponymous Money in the Bank matches (where wrestlers compete to retrieve a briefcase suspended above the ring with a ladder, containing a contract granting rights to challenge one of WWE's world championships at any point within the next year) would take place at its world headquarters building in Stamford, Connecticut, with a new "corporate ladder" gimmick where the briefcases would be suspended above a ring on the building's roof; the wrestlers began on the ground floor of the building and fought their way to the roof. The rest of the event occurred live at the Performance Center.[264]

On 9 April, Florida's Division of Emergency Management added an exemption to the state stay-at-home order for employees of a "professional sports and media production with a national audience", if closed to the general public.[265][266] On 13 April, Mayor of Orange County Jerry Demings acknowledged the change during a news conference, stating that they were made following consultations with the office of Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis, and that they would allow WWE to continue its operations.[267][268] It was reported that WWE had received repeated warnings by state officials over the stay-at-home order, but that DeSantis considered the operation critical to the state economy, and accommodated them by allowing the aforementioned changes.[269][267]

DeSantis acknowledged the changes the next day, explaining that viewers were "starved" for sports content, and that the new exception could also be theoretically used by other sporting events.[265] The same day, U.S. president Donald Trump announced that he was forming an economic advisory group to address the country's emergence and "reopening" from the pandemic; WWE owner and chairman Vince McMahon was named to the group (alongside other major sports commissioners and team owners). McMahon has been an ally of Trump, who has also made appearances on WWE programming in the past, and is also a member of the celebrity wing of the company's Hall of Fame.[270][271][272][273]

On 12 March, All Elite Wrestling (AEW) announced the relocation of its two remaining live broadcasts of Dynamite on TNT for the month of March, scheduled for Rochester, New York and Newark, New Jersey respectively (with the latter originally scheduled to feature AEW's "Blood and Guts" event, also indefinitely postponed),[274] to an alternative location with no audience. AEW stated that it had re-booked the two cities for future episodes in July.[248][275] AEW subsequently cancelled on-location Dynamite broadcasts through at least 13 May.[276][277]

Beginning on 15 March, AEW began to originate Dynamite from a closed stage at TIAA Bank Field's Daily's Place amphitheater in Jacksonville, Florida.[278] Beginning with the 1 April episode, Dynamite moved to an undisclosed location to prevent fans from attempting to interact with the wrestlers;[279] the location was later reported to be in Norcross, Georgia. On 3 April, after a state-wide stay-at-home order was issued, it was reported that AEW had also pre-recorded content for Dynamite on 1 and 2 April, and that they had amassed enough content "for weeks if not months if necessary."[280]

AEW's next pay-per-view event, Double or Nothing, was originally scheduled to take place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Paradise, Nevada on 23 May. The venue, however, canceled all events up through 31 May due to the pandemic.[281] The event was subsequently moved to Daily's Place (with nearby TIAA Bank Field hosting a deliberate empty arena "Stadium Stampede" match).[282]
Sumo

Despite the March honbasho in Osaka taking place behind closed doors without a hitch, bar one wrestler (Chiyomaru) having temporarily withdrawn from the tournament with a fever whilst undergoing tests; both the Natsu basho in May and Nagoya basho in July were initially postponed by two weeks on 4 April. The July tournament had been previously moved forward a week to avoid conflict with the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, which have since been postponed a year.[283][284]

A week later, the Japan Sumo Association confirmed the sport's first case when an undisclosed wrestler in the lower ranks, was tested positive after developing a fever some six days earlier. This led to all wrestlers and officials being ordered to stay indoor until further notice.[285]

Following the extension of Japan's national state of emergency until 31 May, the Sumo Association officially cancelled the May Grand Sumo Tournament on 4 May. It is the second cancellation of a basho since 1946, and the first since March 2011 amidst a match-fixing scandal.[286]

The wrestler who caught the virus was later confirmed to be the Sandanme 11 wrestler Shobushi of Takadagawa stable, who passed away from multiple organ failure on 13 May.[287]

Esports
Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the video game industry § Esports

Impact of the pandemic on esports have primarily affected events and leagues that host competitions in-person (typically to reduce latency between players that can impact games played over the internet, and to allow for spectators akin to traditional sports), which have led to cancellations and postponements, and competitions being held behind closed doors—either in the traditional sense, or with competition being conducted entirely over the internet rather than in-person, with streaming broadcasts (as is typical for esports).[316][317][318]

Sportcal suggested that the esports industry had an opportunity to attract mainstream sports fans as a "viable alternative" to traditional sporting events.[319] Roundhill Investments CEO Will Hershey predicted that games that are straightforward for casual viewers to understand (such as sports games) could see particular interest among this new audience.[317]
Crossover with traditional sports

The suspension of sports competitions has allowed professional athletes to increase their involvement in video game streaming as a means to engage with fans.[317] Esports organisations have also invited professional athletes to compete in specific competitions (often alongside, or in competition with professional players); FaZe Clan organized a charity Call of Duty: Warzone pro-am entitled "Fight 2 Fund" in support of coronavirus-related charities, where professional players were partnered with celebrity participants (such as Ben Simmons, Chad Johnson, and JuJu Smith-Schuster),[317] and several sim racing competitions similarly invited professional race drivers.[320][321]

Some sports teams have taken advantage of sports games in a similar manner, such as the Phoenix Suns holding NBA 2K20 streams with guest players, between the teams the Suns were scheduled to play that night if the season had continued.[322][323] This culminated with a game actually being commentated by the team's radio broadcasters on team flagship KMVP-FM.[323] Sports broadcasters have also taken advantage of esports as a form of replacement programming, with leagues partnering to hold televised tournaments in sports games featuring their players, or in some cases (such as ESPN2 simulcasting the 2020 League of Legends Championship Series) acquiring professional esports events to air on television.[324][325]

The IndyCar Series and NASCAR announced partnerships with sim racing platform iRacing to hold online invitational events featuring series regulars.[326][327][327] The inaugural eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series event drew a television audience of 903,000 on Fox Sports 1—making it the most-watched esports broadcast on U.S. linear television since a 2016 Mortal Kombat X tournament aired by The CW. This record was surpassed the following week with a Texas Motor Speedway race — also aired by the main Fox network — which attracted 1.339 million viewers.[328]
Fencing

On 3 March 2020, the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime (FIE) issued its first bulletin on COVID-19 precautions.[329] On 10 March FIE strongly recommended that all participants in its competitions (athletes and other members of national delegations) fill and carry with them a questionnaire about their health status.[330] On 12 March a FIE circular reported the postponement of six World Cup or Grand Prix competitions and the World Junior/Cadet Championship.[331] Since the World Cup and Grand Prix events were part of the qualifications for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the circular warned on the need to postpone the zonal qualifications tournament for the Olympics. No news was given on other events, and their possible postponement or cancellation.[citation needed]

FIE reported on its web site[332] the postponement of the Olympic Games, but hasn't yet given any information on the World Fencing Championships, which is supposed to happen in non-Olympic years, so there is a 2021 Championship planned (assigned to Cairo), but not a 2020 Championship.[citation needed]

Individual countries had different decisions. For example, on 4 April the Federazione Italiana Scherma announced it was suspending all competitions until 31 August.[333]
Field hockey

Many field hockey leagues in Europe have been suspended or curtailed, including in Spain,[334] England,[335] Germany,[336] and the Netherlands.[337]

In Asia, the 2020 Men's Hockey Junior Asia Cup, 2020 Women's Asian Champions Trophy, and 2020 Women's Hockey Junior Asia Cup were postponed.[341][342] The 2020 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup was originally postponed to 24 September.[343] But on 2 May the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup was officially cancelled.[344]
Futsal

On 9 March 2020, FIFA and AFC announced that the 2020 AFC Futsal Championship in Ashgabat was postponed to 5–16 August.[345][346][347]

Many elite golf tournaments, both professional and amateur, have either been postponed or canceled in response to the pandemic, including the major championships.[348] On 13 March, it was announced that the Masters Tournament (scheduled for 9–12 April) had been postponed.[349][350] The 2020 PGA Championship (scheduled for 11–17 May) was postponed the following week.[351] On 6 April, The R&A announced the cancellation of the 2020 Open Championship, the first cancellation since World War II.[352] This was soon followed by the USGA announcing the rescheduling of the 2020 U.S. Open from 18–21 June to 17–20 September (the week before the 2020 Ryder Cup, which itself was postponed for a year when organizers chose cancellation to playing the event behind closed doors[353]) and to 12–15 November for the Masters (the first ever iteration of the tournament to be played in November) and 6–9 August for the PGA Championship.[354] The ladies majors have been similarly affected, with the LPGA Tour postponing the ANA Inspiration until September.[355]

On 12 March 2020, midway through the first round of the 2020 Players Championship, the PGA Tour announced that the remainder of the tournament and the next three events, the Valspar Championship, WGC Match Play, and the Valero Texas Open, would continue without fan attendance. Subsequently, after completion of the day's play, the tour decided to cancel the remainder of tournament and the three following events.[356][357] On 17 March, the tour announced the cancellation of all scheduled tournaments through 10 May.[358] The European Tour have also cancelled or postponed many tournaments, mostly those scheduled from mid-March through to the end of May,[359] including the Irish Open, a Rolex Series event.[360] The Ladies European Tour originally postponed the 2020 Evian Championship, originally scheduled for 23–26 July, to 6–9 August,[361] but on 9 June announced that the tournament (one of two women's majors outside of the United States) had been cancelled.[362] The Women's British Open is still scheduled, despite the cancellation of its parent men's event.[363]

Other leading professional tours have announced similar measures, as have the bodies responsible for organising leading amateur events.[348] On 1 April, the R&A and the USGA jointly announced that the Curtis Cup was being postponed until 2021, and the British mens and womens amateur championships were being rescheduled from June to August.[364] The LPGA Tour have canceled three tournaments and postponed five others including the ANA Inspiration,[355][348] and the Japan LPGA Tour cancelled twelve tournaments scheduled from March into May.[365]

On 16 April 2020, the PGA Tour announced a condensed schedule for a proposed resumption of play on 11 June with the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas. It aims to play most of the remaining tournaments of the 2019–20 season (preserving at least three quarters of the original schedule in total), concluding with the FedEx Cup Playoffs and the season-ending Tour Championship on Labor Day weekend, followed immediately by the beginning of the 2020–21 season (which will have a modified early-season schedule to accommodate the rescheduled majors) with the Safeway Open. Officials planned the events behind closed doors, although most events were held at courses with residences and/or rental units, and residents were allowed to "attend" the events from their yards on their property, or in the case of the RBC Heritage, from boats traveling the Calibogue Sound. Spectators were expected to return for the Memorial presented by Nationwide, but on 14 July it was announced that the remaining tournaments of the 2019–20 season would be played behind closed doors. The extra delay was intended to give the Tour more time for preparations, as well as take advantage of weeks opened by the cancellation and postponements of majors and the Summer Olympics; only one of the three remaining majors—the PGA Championship—falls within the remainder of the 2019–20 season's schedule.[366][367]

A charity skins game, TaylorMade Driving Relief, was held 17 May at Seminole Golf Club in Juno Beach, Florida, featuring Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff; televised by NBC and Golf Channel, it was the first televised event at Seminole, and the first in the United States since the suspension of PGA Tour play.[368][369] A sequel to Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson's 2018 match play event The Match, The Match: Champions for Charity, was announced for 24 May in a simulcast across WarnerMedia Entertainment networks, with the two participating in a four-ball match at Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Florida, with NFL quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Tom Brady as their respective partners.[370]

With the affect of 2020 season on the USGA and Fox (the U.S. Open in September and the U.S. Women's Open in December), the two parties agreed to end their contract immediately on 29 June 2020, and re-award USGA rights to Golf Channel, which will split the telecast between NBC and Golf Channel.[371]

Recreational golf has also been affected, with many countries and regions ordering the closure of golf clubs and courses.[372][373][374] To enforce social distancing, regulations may require golf clubs to stagger tee times or restrict how services such as pro shops and golf carts are used. The game was played under no-touch rules. Ball washers and bunker rakes were decomissioned and "pin in" rules were placed on the green. To accommodate no-touch golf, holes were modified with an elevated rim or made shallow with a piece of foam (most often a cut pool noodle) or drain pipe or a safety plate. Some courses deployed a lift system that could be lifted with a putter head. If the edge of the hole was above the ground level, the ball is deemed to have been holed if the ball comes in contact with the raised rim or cylinder.[375][376][377]
Greyhound racing

The 2020 English Greyhound Derby was postponed on 16 March.[378] The Arena Racing Company tracks announced a behind closed doors policy from 24 March [379] and racing in Ireland continued behind closed doors.[380] Subsequently, all racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland was postponed [381] until 1 June.

On 12 June it was announced that the 2020 English Greyhound Derby will be run on 31 October.
Gridiron football
Canadian football
CFL

On 12 March, the Canadian Football League (CFL) announced the cancellation or modification of several pre-season events in response to the pandemic. Several scouting combines across Canada and the United States were cancelled, while other events such as rules committee meetings were held remotely. The CFL initially planned to hold both its International and National Drafts in April, but it was announced on 24 March that the Global Draft would be postponed indefinitely.[382][383]

The 2020 regular season had originally been scheduled to begin on 11 June.[384] On 7 April, Commissioner Randy Ambrosie announced that the season would not begin until at least July. In a press statement, he announced that the CFL was exploring multiple options to ensure that the league will be able to play as close to a full season as possible.[385] On 20 May, Ambrosie announced that the season would begin no earlier than September, and the 108th Grey Cup festivities in Regina, Saskatchewan had been cancelled — with the game being hosted by home advantage instead.[386][387] The league has explored the possible use of centralized "hub" cities,[388][389][390] and has requested $30 million in financial assistance from the federal government, and up to $130 million in the event the 2020 season must be scrapped entirely.[391]
University football

U Sports announced on 8 June 2020 that all fall semester national championships had been cancelled. This resulted in the cancellation of the Vanier Cup for the first time since its inception in 1965.[26] Atlantic University Sport, Canada West, and Ontario University Athletics (OUA) all announced that fall semester competition would be cancelled for the season, including football.[26][30][392]
American football
NFL

The National Football League (NFL) has been in its off-season since Super Bowl LIV in early February. Experts acknowledged that the San Francisco 49ers' loss in Super Bowl LIV may have averted early community transmission in California via post-game celebrations and victory parades.[393][394]

On 12 March, various NFL teams began to suspend travel by their coaches and player scouts, while the league itself had advised its non-critical staff to work from home.[395] The league will not allow teams to re-open their facilities until restrictions are sufficiently lifted in all U.S. states that contain NFL teams.[396]

The pandemic had an impact on the 2020 NFL Draft; draft-eligible players were prohibited by the league from travelling to meet team personnel, and vice versa.[395] The draft went on as scheduled, but public festivities in Las Vegas were canceled,[397] and the draft switched to a remote format where team staff convened from home, with all 32 teams being linked to each other and league staff via Microsoft Teams and other communication software. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the first-round picks from his home in Bronxville, New York.[396][398][399][400] The NFL hosted a charity appeal throughout the draft, supporting aid-related charities.[401] During the broadcast, Goodell announced that Las Vegas would instead host the 2022 NFL Draft.[402]

The NFL released its regular season schedule for the 2020 season on 7 May. While the league intends to play its full season as scheduled, the schedule was formulated so that two weeks of games from the 16-week schedule could be removed without repercussions and Super Bowl LV could be delayed to late February in the event the start of the season has to be delayed to late-October. This follows a blueprint from the 2011 season, in which a lockout threatened the season.[403] In addition, the league had to work around the and The Masters, which was postponed to November, in order to avoid a broadcasting conflict on CBS.[404] Due to logistical issues associated with the pandemic, the NFL suspended its international games in London and Mexico City for the season.[405]

On 25 June, the Pro Football Hall of Fame announced that the game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys scheduled for 6 August would be postponed to August 2021. In addition, the ceremony for the five "modern era" inductees will be consolidated with the 2021 class to be announced prior to Super Bowl LV. A separate "Centennial Class" of 15 members was to be inducted on 18 September; that ceremony has yet to be rescheduled.[406]

Whether fans will be allowed to attend games will be on a case-by-case basis, dependent on local regulations. Fox Sports' lead NFL commentator Joe Buck stated that the network already had plans to employ simulated crowds on its telecasts, including sound effects and the possibility of using computer-rendered spectators to provide the illusion of a filled stadium.[407][408]

On 10 July, the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) said that 72 NFL players, or 2.5 percent of players on rosters had tested positive for COVID-19.[409]
College football

On 1 June, the NCAA began allowing players to begin voluntary on-campus team activities (such as workouts); cases began to emerge among players and staff afterward.[410] By 24 June, it was reported that at least 37 schools (about one quarter overall) of schools in the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) — the highest level of competition in U.S. college football — had reported positive cases among student-athletes or staff.[411]

In July 2020, the Big Ten Conference and Pac-12 Conference — two of the "Power Five" conferences in Division I FBS — announced that if fall sports and the 2020 season were played, all games would be played against conference opponents only. Other Power Five conferences have been expected to potentially follow suit. In the second level of Division I football, the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), the Colonial Athletic Association, Ivy League MEAC, and Patriot League have cancelled all fall semester sports (although the CAA is still allowing teams to compete independently if they so choose).[412][413][414][415]

The FBS independent Notre Dame Fighting Irish cancelled its Emerald Isle Classic game in Ireland against Navy, rescheduling it at Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. It also saw three marquee games cancelled due to the Big Ten and Pac-12 restrictions, including a long-running rivalry game against USC); Notre Dame's head coach Brian Kelly stated that the team was evaluating alternatives, and hinted at the possibility of playing additional games against trams from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), where Notre Dame is a member outside of football and ice hockey (as part of its membership, Notre Dame usually schedules five games per-season against ACC opponents).[416][417]
XFL

On 12 March, the XFL (a revival of the one-season 2001 league owned by WWE founder Vince McMahon) announced the suspension of the 2020 season, with all players to be paid their base pay and benefits for the full 2020 regular season; the season was officially canceled on 20 March, with half of its ten-week regular season schedule played.[418] On 10 April, the league announced that it would suspend all operations and lay off all but a few critical executives, and said it was unlikely a 2021 season would be organized and played, with those executives remaining to wind down the league's business and operations after a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing three days later.[419][420]
Gymnastics

Multiple international artistic gymnastics competitions, many of which were Olympic qualifying events, were either canceled or postponed. On 13 March, after already having completed qualifications, the Baku World Cup canceled its event finals.[421] The Stuttgart, Birmingham, and Tokyo World Cups (scheduled to take place between 21 March – 5 April) were all postponed to 2021.[422][423][424] The European Women's Artistic Gymnastics Championships (scheduled to take place 30 April – 3 May) and the European Men's Artistic Gymnastics Championships (scheduled to take place 27–31 May) were both canceled.[425] The Pacific Rim Championships (scheduled to take place 17–19 April) was postponed until 2021.[426]
Handball

The 25–29 March, 2020 European Women's Handball Championship qualification matches in Rotterdam, the Netherlands were cancelled.[427]
Horse racing

Horse racing is one sport that has been less directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic than most others; some countries and regions never stopped operating horse racing events, and racing was one of the first sports to be resumed in other regions.

In the early stages of the outbreak, most horse racing events remained scheduled as normal, but with restricted attendance at racecourses. This included Hong Kong, France,[428] Japan,[429] United Arab Emirates,[430] United States, Australia,[431] Ireland,[432] United Kingdom, Germany, New Zealand, and Singapore.

The Macau Jockey Club suspended racing events from 31 January to 15 February and resumed racing from 22 February. The Korea Racing Authority suspended horse racing from 8 March. Sunland Park Racetrack in the United States canceled its race meeting from 16 March, which included the Sunland Derby, part of the 2020 Road to the Kentucky Derby.[433] Many tracks in North America followed suit over the following weeks, although some remained open depending on state-by-state decisions. In Britain, although the Cheltenham Festival proceeded as normal in mid-March,[434] the Grand National meeting at Aintree in April was cancelled.[435] By mid-March Ireland had become the only major horse racing country in Europe where the sport continued, albeit strictly regulated and behind closed doors.[436] Ireland finally closed down racing on 25 March until at least 19 April.[437]

Churchill Downs announced that the 2020 Kentucky Derby, normally the first leg of the American Triple Crown, would be delayed to 5 September;[438][439] this cascaded to the Preakness Stakes, with the Maryland Jockey Club delaying their race to 3 October. The Belmont Stakes, normally the third leg, was run at a shortened distance of ​1 1⁄8 miles on 20 June as the first leg.[440]

On 22 March, it was announced that the Dubai World Cup, due to celebrate its 25th anniversary running on 28 March, had been cancelled.[441]

On 7 April, Jockey Club Racecourses announced that the first four Classics of the British flat racing season – the 2000 and 1000 Guineas, scheduled to be held on 2–3 May, and the Epsom Oaks and Derby, scheduled to be held on 5–6 June – would be postponed until later in the season. Ascot Racecourse also announced that Royal Ascot, scheduled to be held from 16–20 June, would take place behind closed doors if it gets the go-ahead.[442][443]

Some horsemen are limited from traveling to other racecourses or horse racing facilities under horse racing organizations.[444] Hong Kong-based jockey Keith Yeung felt unwell on 22 March night, but his test for COVID-19 PCR was negative.[445] On 26 March, it was announced that American-based jockey Javier Castellano had tested positive.[446]

Some stakes races prize money were reduced. In Randwick Racecourse, Racing NSW announced all Group One and some Group two races in The Champions meeting prize reduced 50%.[447] Inglis Easter Yearlings Sales are many others horse auction held at fully online. While France Galop resume racing form 11 May, but their prize money dropped by 20-40%.[448] All Royal Ascot Group One races prize money are reduced to 250,000 GBP only.

In the U.S., horse racing gained an increased following as a form of live sports content on television, with efforts by the New York Racing Association and TVG Network to try and attract new viewers and customers for off-track betting at tracks still in operation, and several mainstream sports channels picking up simulcasts of racing to help fill schedules (media attention to horse racing is usually focused upon the Triple Crown). Simulcasts also increased the prominence of lesser-known venues such as Fonner Park in Grand Island, Nebraska — which saw its average daily parimutuel handle surpass its previous single-day record of US$1.2 million on a regular basis[449][450][451]

Poker

As of 18 March most casinos and other gaming venues worldwide have been closed indefinitely, and many upcoming live poker tournaments have been either postponed, canceled, or (in jurisdictions where currently permitted) moved to an online platform. Tournaments originally scheduled to be played live are now being played online, including the 2020 Irish Poker Open.[499]

On 20 April, the 2020 World Series of Poker was postponed.[500]

The pandemic has resulted in a massive increase in online poker traffic.[501] It is believed to have directed both professional and recreational players who normally prefer live poker to online platforms due to the indefinite closure of most casinos and other live gaming venues worldwide, with even many unlicensed venues shutting down. In addition, the sudden dearth of live entertainment options due to the widespread disruption of the sports and entertainment schedules around the world is believed to have resulted in more than the usual number of casual players turning to online poker as an alternative. Many operators reported traffic of double or more the previous volume, depending on the time of day.[citation needed]
Real Tennis

The 2020 Real Tennis World Championship, scheduled to be held at Prested Hall in Feering, Essex, United Kingdom was postponed on 12 March 2020 to October 2020 due to bans on indoor gatherings and sport and international travel restrictions.[502] The championships were further postponed to May 2021.[503] Additionally, other major tournaments including the 2020 French Open and Champions Trophy were cancelled outright.

Rugby Australia and New Zealand Rugby announced that they would play regional tournaments beginning in July and June respectively — Super Rugby AU and Super Rugby Aotearoa — between local teams who play in Super Rugby, to supplant the suspended season.

In one of the first major U.S. sport cancellations of the pandemic, the 2020 BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in Indian Wells, California was postponed on 8 March 2020 as a precautionary measure due to the rising cases in California (the state where it was held), with organizers stating they planned to seek a new date. This would leave out itself to effectively cancel the tournament.[550][551] On 12 March, Mayor of Miami Carlos A.

Multiple players involved — involving Djokovic himself — also contracted the virus.[563][564]

On 16 April, the United States Tennis Association announced the formation of an advisory group to evaluate whether the US Open would be played, with plans expected to be announced by June. USTA chief Mike Dowse stated that it was "highly unlikely" the tournament would be played behind closed doors, since it was "not really in the spirit of the celebration of tennis, and it also goes back to the health and wellbeing of our players and support staff that help run the tournament". He added that "on one sense we're very fortunate that we are the fourth Grand Slam to go, so time is on our side at this point." The state of New York (which at one point, had more cases than any foreign country worldwide),[565] and especially the tournament's host, New York City, saw the largest initial impact of the pandemic in the United States.[566]

On 16 June 2020 Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that it had authorised the U.S. Open to be played in New York on its original dates, subject to safety protocols developed by the USTA and being closed to spectators.
