The 2020 Sparta earthquake was a relatively uncommon intraplate earthquake that occurred near the small town of Sparta, North Carolina, on August 9, 2020 at 8:07 am local time. The earthquake had a moment magnitude of 5.1, and a shallow depth of 3.7 kilometres (2.3 mi).[1] Shaking was reported throughout the Southern, Midwestern, and Northeastern United States[7] It was the strongest earthquake recorded in North Carolina in 104 years,[8], the second-strongest in the state's history,[9] and the largest to strike the East Coast since the 2011 Virginia earthquake.[10][11]

Geology

The earthquake occurred within the eastern Appalachian Mountains which formed due to ancient continental collisions and were comparable to the modern Himalayas. Continental collision occurred in eastern North America during the Caledonian, Acadian, Ouachita, Hercynian, and Alleghenian orogenies. Many thrust faults were formed during this time as the mountain grew in size. When Pangea broke up, the uplift of the Appalachian ultimately ceased, leading to increase erosion rates due to the steep terrain. Ever since, the mountains have been gradually diminishing in size to their current state today.

Erosion carries sediments out of the mountains and down towards the Atlantic Ocean (on the east side) and the Gulf of Mexico (on the west). This movement of sediment can alleviate the pressure of overlying rocks and cause ancient faults (once active during the mountain building processes) to reactivate and create earthquakes. It is believed this is a factor in the 2020 Sparta earthquake as well as others in the region such as the 2011 Virginia earthquake.

The area of the earthquake is located within the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone.

The focal mechanism for the earthquake suggest oblique-reverse faulting on either a northwest, or south-striking fault.[12][1] It produced "Very strong" shaking[13], and over 100,000 reported feeling it.[14]
Foreshocks

There were 8 foreshocks ranging from Md1.8 to 2.6, the earliest of which was a Md2.1 that occurred on August 8, one day prior to the 5.1 mainshock.[3]
Aftershocks

The strongest aftershocks of the sequence were two Md2.2 earthquakes that occurred ~2.5 hours apart.[15][16]
Impacts
Damage

Widespread damage occurred in Sparta, which had already been debilitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.[17] Damages include collapsed ceilings, chimneys, masonry, damaged water mains, cracked and deformed roads, uprooted headstones, and displaced appliances and items.[18][17][19] Wes Brinegar, the town's mayor, issued a state of emergency to apply for FEMA and state financial aid.[19][17]
Injuries

There were no fatalities. A 7-year-old boy in Sparta who was cut when a picture frame fell on him was the only reported injury.[5][6]
