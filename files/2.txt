Presidential elections were held in Belarus on Sunday, 9 August 2020. Early voting began on 4 August and ran until 8 August.[2]

The president was elected directly to serve for five years. Incumbent Alexander Lukashenko was re-elected to run for a sixth term in office (with about 80% of all votes in his favour according to official results), having won every presidential election since 1994,[3] with all but the first being labelled by some[who?] as neither free nor fair.[4] The prior election was reported as not being democratic to this same effect.[5] Opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya declared herself the winner of the elections and called on Lukashenko to start negotiations, meanwhile, her campaign team stated that they were ready to hold "long-term protests" against the official results.[6]

Background

On 8 May 2020, the National Assembly set 9 August as the date for the presidential election.[7] Incumbent President Alexander Lukashenko has been leading the country since the first presidential elections held in 1994, and is described by the West as leading an authoritarian dictatorship following a consolidation of power shortly thereafter.[8] Opposition activists are often pressured or detained by the government, and Lukashenko or those loyal to him control (as of 2019) all of the seats in both houses of the National Assembly, all judicial appointments, the media, and the Central Election Commission (which has the power to approve or deny candidates for political offices).[9]
Electoral system

The President of Belarus is elected using the two-round system. If no candidate obtains over 50% of the vote, a second round is held with the top two candidates. The winner of the second round is elected. A turnout quorum of 50% is applied.[citation needed]

Despite the two-round system being in place, a second round has not been required since 1994, with Lukashenko winning a supermajority of votes in the first round in each subsequent election under dubious circumstances.[citation needed] No election after 1994 has been labeled by the international community as free or fair.[4]
Candidates
Registered candidates

The following list of candidates were officially registered by the Central Election Commission of Belarus (CEC) as candidates for the presidential election on 21 July 2020.[10][11] To register as a candidate for the presidency the candidate is required to submit an application for an initiative group of voters containing no fewer than 100,000 persons.[12]

Free concerts are scheduled for 8 August, the day before the main voting day in the presidential elections, at the main venues in various cities of Belarus.

On 7 May, Belarusian blogger and entrepreneur Syarhei Tsikhanouski has announced on his YouTube channel "Country for Life" that he intended to become a candidate in the presidential election.[54][55] Prior to this event, on 6 May, he was detained by the Belarusian police in the vicinity of Mahilyow.[citation needed]

The police officers refused to present identification (confirming that they were legitimate policemen) and threatened to break the windows of the car that Tsikhanouski was in.[56] Prior to that, a crowd of Tsikhanouski's supporters in Mahilyow released a member of Tsikhanouski's team from the police.[57] A day later, allies of Tsikhanouski were arrested, including a blogger from Slutsk, Uladzimier Niaronski.[58] The Tsikhanouski's team, including Niaronski, were chased by road police and two minivans with members of the police special forces AMAP.[59]

The blogger's arrest was due to his trips around the Belarus that covered consequences of the Lukashenko’s 26-year tenure as a president. The Tsikhanouski trips were popular and gathered hundreds of people who spoke out to him about violations of human rights and economic problems. During these trips, Tsikhanouski and his team was constantly chased by cars with the people which were recording him and his activities, presumably they were employees of the Belarusian special services.[60]

After the Tikhanovski was arrested, his supporters held a series of protests across the Belarus. According to Radio Liberty, 20 to 30 people were detained in Homiel, which is Tsikhanouski's hometown.[58] Viasna Human Rights Centre reported that at least 19 of his supporters were brutally detained in Minsk.[58]

After his arrest, Tsikhanouski was transported to Homiel, where he was placed in a temporary detention center. The formal reason for his detention was his participation in the rally against the integration of Belarus with Russia on 19 December 2019 in Minsk. After his detention, Tsikhanouski has announced on his YouTube channel his intention to run for president of Belarus. The video had recorded 250,000 views in 20 hours after the publication. The aforementioned YouTube channel had 276,000 subscribers as of 10 August.[61] However, the Central Election Commission of Belarus refused to register the initiative group to nominate him.[62][63]

His spouse, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, decided to apply for election as a candidate, her initiative group was successfully registered by the Central Election Commission of Belarus.[64] Tsikhanouski became the head of the initiative group to collect signatures for Tikhanovskaya's participation in the election.

On 20 May, Tsikhanouski was released from the temporary detention center.[65][66] He explained that the pressure of activist supporters helped to achieve it. In an interview with Tsikhanouski after his release, Deutsche Welle drew parallels between the Belarusian blogger and Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and the Ukrainian actor Volodymyr Zelensky, who became the president of Ukraine.[67] RTVI also drew a parallel between Tsikhanouski and Navalny.[68]

Tsikhanouski then began travelling round the country to hold pickets in order to collect signatures for Tsikhanouskaya. Tsikhanouski's pickets were very popular and attracted thousands of people.[citation needed] The queue to the picket in Minsk near Kamarouski market was half a mile long.[citation needed] Several thousand people also attended the picket of Tsikhanouski in Homiel.[citation needed] Tsikhanouski announced that he was collecting signatures for fair election in Belarus.

Tsikhanouski uses the slogan "Stop the cockroach!" in his campaign, which is chanted by his supporters. The symbol of the campaign is a slipper. The slogan "Stop the cockroach!" refers to the fairy tale "Cockroach" by Soviet poet Kornei Chukovsky about how a "moustached cockroach" intimidated all the animals and became their ruler. Apparently, this slogan is a reference to the current leadership of Belarus. Slippers are supposedly a traditional means of pest control.[69] Euronews journalists called the events in Belarus the "Slipper Revolution", demonstrating the quote of the Belarusian activist Franak Viačorka with this phrase.[70]

On 29 May, Tsikhanouski visited Hrodna to collect signatures for his wife. On the same day, the head of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko alluded to Tsikhanouski at a meeting with workers of Minsk Tractor Works: "They come cool, all in jeeps — 10-12 cars... we know whose cars he drives, who finances it. We know where he comes from, what his citizenship is and stuff... We all know that. I'm already looking, they're giving me information, our people have already seen it."[71] Tsikhanouski commented on Lukashenko's statement to the Nasha Niva newspaper: "My last name isn't there, but a hint of me: "We know his citizenship." They have information, analytical work! I have one citizenship, I never had any other. In terms of money — I've had business since 2005, I have money."[72]

A few hours after Lukashenko's statement, when Tsikhanouski was talking with the residents of Hrodna, nearby there was a provocation, where policeman fall by him self and was laying on the ground whistling. After one minute and thirteen seconds later, Tsikhanouski was detained by AMAP.[73] Eight vans arrived to detain him.[74] The soldiers of the special unit escorted Tsikhanouski into a police GAZelle van without showing their IDs. During the arrest, the van's door was broken. The blogger's supporters tried to stop the vans from leaving the place of detention. Unidentified people in tracksuits then cleared the way for the police transport to leave in a struggle with Tsikhanouski's supporters.[74] Then supporters then went to the police station in Hrodna to demand the blogger's release.[75][76]

Shortly after Tsikhanouski's arrest, Belarusian state-owned TV channel Belarus 1 showed a story where the events in Hrodna were covered as follows: "From the very first minutes, this collection of signatures turned into a rally, and according to the law, it is prohibited to hold campaign meetings at this stage of the election campaign. As a result, this manner of communication turned into a scuffle. The police, trying to restore order, found themselves in the epicenter of the scuffle, which was arranged on the square. One of the police officers was attacked."[77][78] The leader of the United Civil Party, retired lieutenant colonel of the Belarusian police, Mikalai Kazlou, noted that during his speech at Minsk Tractor Plant, Alexander Lukashenko "gave the command to screw, twist, throw in jail, and the minister immediately seized this opportunity and created a provocation". Kazlou also noted that all the policemen involved in this provocation would be exposed and brought to justice.[79]

According to the Vesna Human Rights Centre, at least 13 people were detained, including two members of Tsikhanouskaya's initiative group and three assistants of Tsikhanouski. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus announced that investigators had opened a criminal case for violence against police officers.[80]

Tsikhanouskaya made an official statement regarding the detention of her husband and the head of the headquarters of her initiative group in Hrodna: "I officially declare: Today, 29 May, during a picket in Hrodna in support of my candidacy for the presidency there was a "dirty" provocation against Syarhei Leanidovich Tsikhanouski, head of the headquarters of my initiative group. He was detained. I declare responsibly that the picket was legal and peaceful. In connection with this, I demand the immediate release of the head of my initiative group, otherwise, I will regard it as a violation of my constitutional rights and pressure on me as a candidate for the presidency of Belarus". She promised to submit relevant applications to the CEC and the Interior Ministry.[81]

The first two mass rallies after registration by the Tsikhanouskaya campaign were held on 19 July in Banhalore Square in Minsk and the city of Dzyarzhynsk with an audience of around 7,500. She was joined on stage by Babaryka's campaign manager Maryja Kalesnikava and Tsepkalo's wife Veranika as they had announced earlier that they would merge their campaigns.[82][83]

Local governments cancelled several campaign events that Tsikhanouskaya had planned to hold in the run-up to the elections.[2]
"Female Solidarity"

Before the 2020 presidential election, Alexander Lukashenko insisted that Belarus is not ready for a woman to be president. On 17 July the three women representing the main opposition candidates (Tsikhanouskaya, Tsepkalo's wife Veronica and Babaryka's campaign manager Maryja Kalesnikava) merged their campaigns, pitting "Female Solidarity" against Lukashenko.[84]
Pressure by authorities and the government

Viktar Babaryka was detained on 18 June during the reported arrest of several hundred opposition supporters. Charges of embezzlement and fraud have been brought against Babaryka, who is currently being held in a State Security Committee detention centre in Minsk.[85][86][87]

Valery Tsepkalo, who was not allowed to register as a candidate, and has "gone to Moscow with his children, fearing for his safety". During an interview, Tsepkalo mentioned that his friends in law enforcement agencies warned "an order had gone out for my arrest". Tsepkalo said he planned to give press conferences in Russia, Ukraine, Western Europe and the United States to expose "the true nature of the Belarusian regime." His wife, Veronika Tsepkalo, is remaining in Belarus to help the campaign of Lukashenko's main competitor in the election, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.[88][89]

In June, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya released a video saying that she had been threatened with arrest, and her children being taken away if she continued to campaign. She had to send her children abroad to live with their grandmother for their safety.[90] The children of opposition candidates have been taken away before and put into state orphanages.[91]

According to Belarusian Electoral Code (articles 45 and 451[92][93]), local authorities have to determine some outdoor sites for rallies and meetings, where mass events are possible. In Minsk, the authorities allowed six sites to be used for this purpose (none of them in the city centre)[94], while only one site was usually allocated in each of the small towns. During the 2020 election, the authorities and confidants of Lukashenko widely used booking of these sites to prevent independent candidates to meet with people. In Pinsk (Brest region), local authorities provided only one site for meetings with candidates, and this site was booked by a confidant of Lukashenko (Tacciana Lugina, mayor of Pinsk) from 24 July to 8 August. Due to this, Tsikhanouskaya failed to visit Pinsk on 2 August.[95][96] In Stolin (Brest region), the only site was booked by Lugina too from 27 July to 8 August every day from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.[97]

On 4 August, Tsikhanouskaya planned to visit Slutsk and Salihorsk (Minsk region). On 3 August, local authorities of Slutsk informed the confidant of Tsikhanouskaya that the meeting couldn't be held due to "urgent repair" of the only provided site, but they didn't provide the alternative site (as requried by law).[98] The meeting in Salihorsk was also cancelled by the authorities at the last moment. The people who gathered in Slutsk and Salihorsk were asked to leave and those who refused were arrested.[99][100][101] Meetings with another independent candidate Andrey Dmitriyeu in Liepiel and Polatsk (Viciebsk region) were cancelled at the last moment for similar reasons.[102]

On 6 August, Tsikhanouskaya was forced to cancel a previously announced rally in Minsk due to full booking at all six sites in the city that were made available by the authorities. Instead, she, with Veranika Tsepkalo and Maryja Kalesnikava, visited one of the booked sites and invited people to join them, but the policemen did not allow three of them to come in. During the event, DJs put the song "[We Want] Changes!" by Viktor Tsoi and thus supported Tsikhanouskaya. They were later sentenced to detention for 10 days.[103][104][105][106]

On 8 August, Maryja Maroz (campaign manager of Tsikhanouskaya) and Maryja Kalesnikava (see above) were arrested, but Kalesnikava was freed a few hours later.[107][108]

Opinion polls

According to a poll conducted back in March-April 2020 by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, the level of trust of current Lukashenko in the capital city of Belarus is 24%. At the same time, 11% of the poll participants trust the Central Election Commission.[110]

The state-affiliated analytical center "Ecoom" commissioned by the state TV channel ONT, which was criticized for its biased coverage of the election campaign, conducted a sociological survey of electoral moods and preferences of citizens. According to this data, incumbent President Alexander Lukashenko enjoyed support of 72.3% of citizens. At the same time, no more than 10% in total were ready to vote for the remaining candidates.[111][112]

Opinion polling in Belarus requires a government license. Media outlets are also banned from conducting online polls regarding the election.[113]

Oversight

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe reported that it would not be monitoring the 2020 election as it had not been sent a timely invitation. It had not recognised any elections in Belarus as free and fair since 1995.[114] The only international observers in the country were from Russia, Azerbaijan and a few other countries with questionable democratic records.[115] On 4 August 2020, the first day of early voting in the election, the CEC reported a turnout of almost 5%.[116][117] However, independent observers disputed this figure and claimed that it was inflated.[117]
External images Vote cabin without curtain
Vote cabin with a deliberately drawn curtain

In several polling stations, curtains were deliberately removed from the vote cabins, leaving them covered on only three sides.[118]

A few days prior to the election, a number of journalists and bloggers were arrested on weak and spurious charges, or were denied accreditation to cover the elections,[115] bringing the total to over 100 arrests made since January. It was thought that the government wants to reduce external scrutiny of the election.[119]

Honest People, an independent association in Belarus that monitors elections, reported having found 5096 violations from observers. They also questioned the election commission's reported turnout statistics. The group said that around 70 election observers were detained.[120]
Turnout and results

Turnout was said to be 4.98% on 4 August,[117][121] 12.75% on 5 August,[122] 22.47% on 6 August,[123] and 32.24% on 7 August.[citation needed]

On 9 August, turnout was reported to be 84.05% as of 20:00, more than the 50% required to validate the election.[124][125]
Exit poll

According to state-sponsored Russian media outlet RIA Novosti[126], official exit polls indicate a win by Lukashenko. The below figures are widely disputed.
Date 	Source 	Lukashenko 	Tsikhanouskaya 	Kanapatskaya 	Cherachen 	Dmitriyeu 	Lead
				
9 August 2020 	RIA Novosti 	79.7 	6.8 	2.3 	0.9 	1.1 	72.9
Preliminary results

The result of the vote, "as in previous elections, was never in any real doubt" and had a "foregone nature" according to The New York Times, stating that Lukashenko "controls vote counting, [and abused] a vast security apparatus and a noisy state media machine unwavering in its support for him and contempt for his rivals." Tsikhanouskaya, the principal challenger, was stated to have gone into hiding in Minsk after security agents detained at least eight members of her campaign staff on the day of the election.[115]

Protocols of the polling stations

After finishing the counting of votes, the polling stations posted their protocols. People took photos of the protocols from different cities and villages, which testified that the support of Tsikhanouskaya was roughly equal or even several times higher than of Lukashenko there.[128][129]
Aftermath
Main article: 2020 Belarusian protests

After state TV revealed the results of an exit poll showing a landslide Lukashenko victory, clashes between protesters and riot police broke out in Minsk. Reports of injuries and the use of stun grenades and rubber bullets emerged.[130]

The main opposition candidate, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said in a news conference that she did not trust the exit poll, saying, "I believe my eyes, and I see that the majority is with us".[130]

As polling closed many internet service providers lost routing, the communication losses were widespread as police and military closed down most of Minsk.[131]

On the second night after the allegedly falsified results were announced, protesters barricaded the area around the Rīga market. Security forces responded by tear-gassing the protesters and using flashbangs.[132]

After being released from a seven-hour-long detention on election night, once the election results were announced, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya fled to Lithuania. She had previously sent her children abroad before the elections for their safety.
International reactions
International organizations

     European Union - High Representative of the European Union Josep Borrell and European Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi issued a joint statement condemning police violence following the election and stating that the EU would monitor further developments.[133] The EU later stated that it would re-evaluate its relationship with Belarus.[134]

He called for the results of Sunday’s election "to reflect the will of the people."[149]
     Czech Republic - The Czech foreign minister criticised the election.[150]
     Lithuania - Linas Linkevičius, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania, condemned the "obviously undemocratic" elections and promised that Lithuania will do everything she can to support the freedom voice in Belarus. The next day opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya was apparently forced to cross the border from Belarus to Lithuania[151] and was reported by Linkevičius as "safe".[149][152]
     Germany - German government spokesperson Steffen Seibert declared that the minimum standards for democratic elections were not observed during the vote, that the reports of the opposition about election fraud are credible. He also said that the Belarusian political leadership must accept the will of the people and condemn the use of force against peaceful demonstrators and the arrest of journalists and civil rights activists.[153]
     Poland - The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on the Belarusian authorities to "stop actions that escalate the situation and start respecting fundamental human rights".[154] Additionally, the Prime Minister of Poland called for an emergency meeting of the European Council concerning the situation in Belarus.[155]
     Slovakia - Minister of Foreign and European Affairs of the Slovak Republic, Ivan Korčok, labelled the interventions of the Belarusian regime against its political opponents and citizens peacefully expressing their opinion as unacceptable. The Slovak Republic "appeals to president Lukashenko to abide by the basic principles of democracy and freedom of expression. No one can be persecuted for expressing their views."[156]
     Sweden - Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ann Linde, expressed concerns over how protesters in Belarus were beaten and arrested.

He claimed that "severe restrictions on ballot access for candidates, [the] prohibition of local independent observers at polling stations, intimidation tactics employed against opposition candidates, and the detentions of peaceful protesters and journalists marred the process." He urged the Belarusian government to refrain from using force and called on it to respect the rights of all Belarusians to assemble peacefully. The administration criticized the use of internet shutdowns and detention of opposition supporters and called for those detained to be released.[160] Separately, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany stated the U.S. was "deeply concerned" about the elections.[161]
