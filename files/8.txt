The MV Wakashio oil spill occurred offshore of Pointe d'Esny, south of Mauritius, after the bulk carrier Wakashio ran aground on 25 July 2020 at around 16:00 UTC,[1] and subsequently began to leak fuel oil in the following weeks. As of 10 August, an estimated 1,000 metric tons of oil had spilled from the ship.

Background

MV Wakashio, a large capesize bulk carrier, was built by the Universal Shipbuilding Corporation of Tsu, Japan.[2] She was laid down on 23 September 2004, launched on 9 March 2007, and was delivered on 30 May 2007.[2] She has a deadweight tonnage of 203,000 tons, a length overall of 299.95 metres (984 ft 1 in), and a beam of 50 metres (164 ft 1 in).[2][3] She is powered by a single diesel engine that gives her a service speed of 14.5 knots (26.9 km/h).[2] The ship belongs to Okiyo Maritime Corp., an associate company of Nagashiki Shipping Co. Ltd.,[4] and is operated by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines.[5] At the time of her grounding, Wakashio was flying under a Panamanian flag of convenience, despite her Japanese ownership.[3] The ship was sailing without cargo,[6] and departed from Lianyungang, China on 4 July, stopped in Singapore, and was scheduled to reach Tubarão, Brazil on 13 August.[7] A crew of 20 was on board,[5] none of whom were injured.[4]
Accident

Wakashio ran aground on 25 July, but did not immediately begin leaking oil.[6] Oil began to leak from the ship on 6 August,[6] by which time Mauritius authorities were trying to control the spill and minimize its effects, isolating environmentally sensitive areas of the coast, while waiting for help from foreign countries to pump out an estimated 3,890 tons of oil remaining on board.[8] By 10 August, about 1,000 metric tons of fuel had spilled, with estimates of the remaining oil onboard ranging from 2,500 to 3,000 metric tons.[6][9] High winds and 5 metres (16 ft) waves halted cleanup efforts on 10 August; visible cracks in the hull of the ship led to worries that the ship might "break in two," according to Mauritius' prime minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth.[10]

The island's environment minister Kavy Ramano, together with the fisheries minister, told the press that it was the first time that the country faced a catastrophe of this magnitude, and that they were insufficiently equipped to handle the problem.[3]

The grounding happened at an area which is listed under the Ramsar convention on wetlands of international importance and near the marine park of Blue Bay.[3][11] Tourism plays a major role in the economy of Mauritius, accounting for about 63 billion Mauritian rupees (US$1.59 billion) in spending in 2019, and is centered around marine scenery and animals likely to be endangered by the oil spill.[12] Greenpeace stated that "[t]housands of species [...] are at risk of drowning in a sea of pollution, with dire consequences for Mauritius’ economy, food security and health."[12]
Reactions

Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth declared a “state of environmental emergency” and requested French help on 7 August.[13] "When biodiversity is in peril, there is urgency to act," French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted, "France is there. Alongside the people of Mauritius. You can count on our support dear Jugnauth."[14] France sent both military and civilian equipment and personnel from its overseas territory of Réunion.[12]

Local volunteers joined forces to remedy the situation by making cloth barriers stuffed with straw and human hair.[15] Japan sent a six-member crew of specialists to help in the cleanup.[10]
