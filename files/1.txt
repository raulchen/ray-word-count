The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector.[1] The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown.[2]

Supply shortages are expected to affect a number of sectors due to panic buying, increased usage of goods to fight the pandemic, and disruption to factories and logistics in mainland China. There have been instances of price gouging.[3] There have been widespread reports of shortages of pharmaceuticals,[4] with many areas seeing panic buying and consequent shortages of food and other essential grocery items.[5][6][7] The technology industry, in particular, has been warning about delays to shipments of electronic goods.[8][needs update]

Global stock markets fell on 24 February 2020 due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.[9][10] By 28 February 2020, stock markets worldwide saw their largest single-week declines since the 2008 financial crisis.[11][12][13] Global stock markets crashed in March 2020, with falls of several percent in the world's major indices.

Possible instability generated by an outbreak and associated behavioural changes could result in temporary food shortages, price spikes, and disruption to markets. Such price rises would be felt most by vulnerable populations who depend on markets for their food as well as those already depending on humanitarian assistance to maintain their livelihoods and food access. As observed in the 2007–2008 food prices crisis, the additional inflationary effect of protectionist policies through import tariffs and export bans could cause a significant increase in the number of people facing severe food insecurity worldwide.[14]

As the pandemic spreads, global conferences and events across technology, fashion, and sports are being cancelled or postponed.[15] While the monetary impact on the travel and trade industry is yet to be estimated, it is likely to be in the billions and increasing.

Background
Movement of WTI price from 2019. The crash started in mid-February 2020. On 20 April 2020, prices dropped below zero for the first time in recorded history.[16]

The pandemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday. A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.[17][18] Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.[19] In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most workplaces not to re-open until that date.[20][21] These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.[21] Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations.[22][23]

The demand for personal protection equipment has risen 100-fold, according to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom. This demand has led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also induced delays on the supply of medical items for four to six months.[24][25]
Overall economic contraction
Main article: Coronavirus recession

The coronavirus recession is an economic recession happening across the world economy in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[26][27][28][29]

Some economists suggest that China's economy may contract for the first time since the 1970s. Caixin's purchasing managers index for the services sector of China's economy fell to 26.5 in February 2020, the lowest figure recorded since the survey's advent in 2005,[30] and car sales dropped 86% in China in February.[31] As the coronavirus spreads around the world, the stock markets have experienced their worst crash since 1987.[31]
Economic recovery programmes
Further information: Coronavirus recession § National fiscal responses
See also: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment § Investments and other economic measures

Nations, cities and other collectives with governance mechanisms worldwide have announced the development and implementation of programmes for guided economic recovery.[32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39]
Agriculture
Food crisis contexts

In food crisis countries, up to 80 percent of the population relies on agriculture for their livelihoods. Therefore, any further disruptions to food production and related value chains, for example in the form of reduced availability of critical inputs or restricted access to lands or markets, could be catastrophic for vulnerable populations.[14]

The agriculture sector plays an important role in influencing migratory patterns. Transhumant pastoral populations are likely to be hard hit by any border closures, as they rely on seasonal movements of livestock for their food and income. The disruption of traditional transhumance patterns and the creation of new ones may lead to tensions and even violent conflicts between resident and pastoralist communities, resulting in local displacement and increased levels of poverty and food insecurity.[14]

According to FAO, it is crucial to maintain and support the continuous functioning of local food markets, value chains and agri-food systems in food crisis contexts, including through ongoing and scaled up support to food processing, transport, marketing, and so forth; strengthening of local producers’ groups to maintain negotiation power and access to markets; and, advocating for trade corridors to remain open as much as possible during COVID-19 related movement restrictions.[14]
Financial markets
Main articles: Financial market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 stock market crash
See also: 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war

Economic turmoil associated with the coronavirus pandemic has wide-ranging and severe impacts upon financial markets, including stock, bond and commodity (including crude oil and gold) markets. Major events included the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war that resulted in a collapse of crude oil prices and a stock market crash in March 2020. The United Nations Development Programme expects a US$220 billion reduction in revenue in developing countries, and expects COVID-19's economic impact to last for months or even years.[40][31] Some expect natural gas prices to fall.[41]
Manufacturing

New vehicle sales in the United States have declined by 40%.[42] The American Big Three have all shut down their US factories.[43] The German automotive industry came into the crisis after having already suffered from the Dieselgate-scandal, as well as competition from electric cars.[44] Boeing and Airbus suspended production at some factories. A survey conducted by the British Plastics Federation (BPF) explored how COVID-19 is impacting manufacturing businesses in the United Kingdom (UK). Over 80% of respondents anticipated a decline in turnover over the next 2 quarters, with 98% admitting concern about the negative impact of the pandemic on business operations.[45][46]
The arts, entertainment and sport
Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage

The epidemic had a sudden and substantial impact on the arts and cultural heritage (GLAM) sectors worldwide. The global health crisis and the uncertainty resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals – both employed and independent – across the sector. By March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. Many individuals temporarily or permanently lost contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, financial stimulus from governments and charities for artists, have provided greatly differing levels of support, depending on the sector and the country. In countries such as Australia, where the arts contributed to about 6.4% of GDP, effects on individuals and the economy have been significant.[47][48]
Cinema
Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema

The pandemic has impacted the film industry. Across the world and to varying degrees, cinemas have been closed, festivals have been cancelled or postponed, and film releases have been moved to future dates. As cinemas closed, the global box office dropped by billions of dollars, while streaming became more popular and the stock of Netflix rose; the stock of film exhibitors dropped dramatically. Almost all blockbusters to be released after the March opening weekend were postponed or cancelled around the world, with film productions also halted. Massive losses in the industry have been predicted.[citation needed]
Sport
Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports

Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed,[49] including the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which were postponed on 24 March 2020 until 2021.[50][51]
Television
Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television

The COVID-19 pandemic has shut down or delayed production of television programs in several countries.[citation needed] However, a joint report from Apptopia and Braze[52] showed a 30.7% increase in streaming sessions worldwide on platforms such as Disney+, Netflix, and Hulu during the month of March.[53]
Video games
Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the video game industry

The pandemic also affected the video game sector to a smaller degree. As the outbreak appeared in China first, supply chains affected the manufacturing and production of some video game consoles, delaying their releases and making current supplies scarcer. As the outbreak and pandemic spread, several keystone trade events, including E3 2020, were cancelled over concerns of further spread. The economic impact on the video game sector is not expected to be as large as in film or other entertainment sectors as much of the work in video game production can be decentralised and performed remotely, and products distributed digitally to consumers regardless of various national and regional lockdowns on businesses and services.[54]
Publishing
Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on journalism

The pandemic is predicted to have a dire effect on local newspapers in the United States, where many were already severely struggling beforehand.[55]

In light of the public health situation in which includes afflicted regions where retail sectors deemed non-essential have been ordered closed for the interim,[56] Diamond Comic Distributors announced on 24 March 2020 a full suspension of distributing published material and related merchandise as 1 April 2020 until further notice.[57] As Diamond has a near-monopoly on printed comic book distribution, this is described as an "extinction-level event" that threatens to drive the entire specialized comic book retail sector out of business with that one move.[58] As a result, publishers like IDW Publishing and Dark Horse Comics have suspended publication of their periodicals while DC Comics is exploring distribution alternatives including an increased focus on online retail of digital material.[59]
Retail

Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on retail

The pandemic has impacted the retail sector. Shopping centres around the world responded by reducing hours or closing down temporarily. As of 18 March 2020, the footfall to shopping centres fell by up to 30%, with significant impact in every continent.[60] Additionally, product demand exceeded supply for many consumables, resulting in empty retail shelves.[61][62] In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigou shoppers to re-sell into the China market. "The virus crisis, while frightening, has a silver lining".[63][64]

Some retailers have employed contactless home delivery or curbside pickup for items purchased through e-commerce sites.[65][66] By April, retailers had started implementing "retail to go" models where consumers could pick up their orders. An estimated 40% of shoppers were shopping online and choosing to pick up in-store, a behaviour that had suddenly doubled as compared to the previous year.[67]

Small-scale farmers have been embracing digital technologies as a way to directly sell produce, and community-supported agriculture and direct-sell delivery systems are on the rise.[68]
Retail suffered 40-60% drop in footfall in Mar 2020[69]

In mid-April, Amazon confirmed that workers at over half of its 110 U.S. warehouses had been diagnosed with coronavirus.[70]

On 16 June, the United States Department of Commerce announced that retail sales for the month of May had seen an increase of 17.7% from April as states began to reopen and lift restrictions. According to CNBC, This marks the biggest one month jump in the history of retailing in the United States.[71]
Business closures

By April, department store retailers JCPenney, Nordstrom, Macy's and Kohl's had lost $12.3 billion combined in market caps. Neiman Marcus and JCPenney defaulted on bond payments in April, preparing internally for bankruptcy court and bankruptcy protection.[72] J.Crew and Neiman Marcus filed for bankruptcy during the first week of May; they were reportedly the first two major retailers to do so during the pandemic.[73][74] JCPenney filed for bankruptcy on 15 May.[75]

In May, Pier 1 announced it would close as soon as possible. It had sought court protection in February and had hoped that someone would buy the business, but the subsequent recession made this seem unlikely.[76]
Restaurant sector

Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the restaurant industry

The pandemic has impacted the restaurant business. In the beginning of March 2020, some major cities in the US announced that bars and restaurants would be closed to sit-down dinners and limited to takeout orders and delivery.[77] Later in the month, many states put in place restrictions that required restaurants to be takeout or delivery only.[78] Some employees were fired, and more employees lacked sick leave in the sector compared to similar sectors.[79][80] With only carry-out and delivery services, most servers and bartenders were laid off, prompting these employees creating "virtual tip jars" across 23 U.S. cities.[81] In the United States, an initiative known as the "Great American Takeout" called on people under quarantine to support local restaurants each Tuesday by ordering takeout for curbside pickup or using food delivery services. It began in late March 2020.[82]
Science and technology
Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on science and technology
See also: Science § Science and the public

The pandemic has impacted productivity of science, space and technology projects, and to the world's leading space agencies – including NASA and the European Space Agency having to halt production of the Space Launch System, James Webb Space Telescope, and put space science probes into hibernation or low power mode. Most of both agencies' field centers have directed most personnel to telework.[83][84][85][86] The pandemic may have improved scientific communication or established new forms of it. For instance a lot of data is being released on preprint servers and is getting dissected on social Internet platforms and sometimes in the media before entering formal peer review. Scientists are reviewing, editing, analyzing and publishing manuscripts and data at record speeds and in large numbers. This intense communication may have allowed an unusual level of collaboration and efficiency among scientists.[87]
Tourism

Philia Tounta summarised likely effects of COVID-19 on global tourism early in March 2020:[92]

    severe effects because tourism depends on travel
    quarantine restrictions
    fear of airports and other places of mass gathering
    fears of illness abroad
    issues with cross-border medical insurance
    tourism enterprise bankruptcies
    tourism industry unemployment
    airfare cost increases
    damage to the image of the cruise industry

Events and institutions
Main article: List of major affected events

The pandemic has caused the cancellation or postponement of major events around the world. Some public venues and institutions have closed.[93]
Transportation

The cruise ship industry has also been heavily affected by a downturn, with the share prices of the major cruise lines down 70–80%.[94]

In many of the world's cities, planned travel went down by 80–90%.[95]
Aviation
Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation

The pandemic has had a significant impact on the aviation industry due to the resulting travel restrictions as well as a slump in demand among travellers. Significant reductions in passenger numbers have resulted in planes flying empty between airports and the cancellation of flights.

United States passenger airlines can expect about $50 billion in subsidies from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.[96]
Cruise lines
Main article: COVID-19 pandemic on cruise ships

Cruise lines had to cancel sailings after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bookings and cancellations grew as extensive media coverage of ill passengers on quarantined ships hurt the industry's image.[96]

Cruise line stock fell sharply on 27 March 2020 when the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act excluded companies that are not "organized" under United States law. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) tweeted: "The giant cruise companies incorporate overseas to dodge US taxes, flag vessels overseas to avoid US taxes and laws, and pollute without offset. Why should we bail them out?" Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) tweeted that cruise lines should register and pay taxes in the United States if they expect a financial bailout. U.S-based employees and small, American-owned companies are eligible for financial assistance.[96]
Gambling and betting

According to the American Gaming Association, the industry will be hit by losses up to $43.5 billion in economic activity in the following months. Some projection was that the sports gambling industry may lose $140 million alone in the fourth weekend of March (21–22 March 2020) on lost NCAA basketball tournament bets.[97] Gambling companies are eager to shift customers from retail into online casino and poker games in order to fight the loss of revenue due to the cancellation of sports fixtures and the shutdown of betting shops. Gambling groups increased the advertising of online casino games and play on social media. Some argue that virtual racing, as well as draw based games, are also proving popular.[98][99] Some software betting providers have specially designed campaigns promoting online betting solutions in order to attract betting companies. Long term consequences to the betting and gambling industry might be: Death of small retail operators and providers, increase in M&A, more focus on online, innovation in online meaning that even the existing products like the sportsbook will pay closer attention to obscure sports like soap soccer or quidditch and more prominent spot for virtual games online.[100]

In Macau, the world's top gambling destination by revenue, all casinos were closed for 15 days in February 2020[101] and suffered a year-on-year revenue drop of 88%, the worst ever recorded in the territory.[102]
Unemployment

The International Labour Organization stated on 7 April that it predicted a 6.7% loss of job hours globally in the second quarter of 2020, equivalent to 195 million full-time jobs. They also estimated that 30 million jobs were lost in the first quarter alone, compared to 25 million during the 2008 financial crisis.[103]

In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.[104] Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.[105][106]

In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.[107] The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rate may hit 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.[108]

The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of migrant workers unemployed.[109][110]

The survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some type of job loss.[111][112]

Nearly 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since it went into lockdown in mid-March 2020.[113] During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme.[114]

Almost half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers on a government-subsidized short-time working schemes known as Kurzarbeit.[115][116] The German short-time work compensation scheme has been copied by France and Britain.[117]

The pandemic’s economic impacts are likely to increase sexual exploitation and child marriage, leaving women and girls in fragile economies and refugee contexts particularly vulnerable.[118][119][120]

The potential combined impact of COVID-19 on unemployment, households’ purchasing power, food prices, and food availability in local markets could severely jeopardize access to food in the most vulnerable countries.[14]
Impact by gender

When crises strike, women and girls are harder hit by economic impacts than men. Around the world, women generally earn less and save less, are the majority of single-parent households and disproportionately hold more insecure jobs in the informal economy or service sector with less access to social protections. This leaves them less able to absorb the economic shocks than men.[121][122][123][124][125][126][127] For many families, school closures and social distancing measures have increased the unpaid care and domestic load of women at home, making them less able to take on or balance paid work. The situation is worse in developing economies, where a larger share of people are employed in the informal economy in which there are far fewer social protections for health insurance, paid sick leave and more. Although globally informal employment is a greater source of employment for men (63 per cent) than for women (58 per cent), in low and lower-middle income countries a higher proportion of women are in informal employment than men.[121][122][123][124][125][126][127] In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, around 92 per cent of employed women are in informal employment compared to 86 per cent of men. It is likely that the pandemic could result in a prolonged dip in women’s incomes and labour force participation. The ILO estimates global unemployment to rise between 5.3 million (“low” scenario) and 24.7 million (“high” scenario) from a base level of 188 million in 2019 as a result of COVID-19’s impact on global GDP growth. By comparison, global unemployment went up by 22 million during the 2008-9 global financial crisis. Women informal workers, migrants, youth and the world's poorest, among other vulnerable groups, are more susceptible to lay-offs and job cuts. For example, UN Women survey results from Asia and the Pacific are showing that women are losing their livelihoods faster than men and have fewer alternatives to generate income. And, in the U.S., men’s unemployment went up from 3.55 million in February to 11 million in April in 2020 while women’s unemployment – which was lower than men’s before the crisis – went up from 2.7 million to 11.5 million over the same period, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The picture is even bleaker for young women and men aged 16–19, whose unemployment rate jumped from 11.5 per cent in February to 32.2 per cent in April.[121][122][123][124][125][126][127]

The economy of China was anticipated to generate billions in economic output. Morgan Stanley expected the economy of China to grow by between 5.6% (worst-case scenario) to 5.9% for 2020.[128] For reference, China generated US$143 billion in February 2019, the month of Chinese New Year.[129] The Chinese Ministry of Transport reported that trips on trains dropped 73% to 190 million trips from the previous year. Factories, retailers, and restaurant chains closed.[130]

All 70,000 theatre screens in the country were shuttered, wiping out the entire box office. This is drastically in stark difference from the week of Chinese New Year in 2019 that generated $836 million.[131]

Though cautioning that the economic impact would be short-term, PRC National Development and Reform Commission party secretary Cong Liang views small and medium businesses encountering more difficulties in their operations. Human Resources and Social Security Assistant Minister You Jun specified that agricultural workers and college graduates would have difficulties.[132]

Tourism in China has been hit hard by travel restrictions and fears of contagion, including a ban on both domestic and international tour groups.[133] Many airlines have either cancelled or greatly reduced flights to China and several travel advisories now warn against travel to China. Many countries, including France, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, have evacuated their nationals from the Wuhan and Hubei provinces.[134]

The majority of schools and universities have extended their annual holidays to mid-February.[135] Overseas students enrolled at Chinese universities have been returning home over fears of being infected—the first cases to be reported by Nepal and Kerala, a southern state of India, were both of students who had returned home.[136][136][137] Nearly 200 million students have been affected by the in-school closures, with the second semester after the Chunyun resuming on 17 February through online classes for students to follow from their homes instead. The Ministry of Education has introduced a 7,000-server supported "national Internet cloud classroom" to cater to the 50 million elementary and middle school student populations.[138]

The Finance Ministry of China announced it would fully subsidise personal medical costs incurred by patients.[139]

CNN reported that some people from Wuhan "have become outcasts in their own country, shunned by hotels, neighbors and – in some areas – placed under controversial quarantine measures."[140]

The sale of new cars in China has been affected due to the outbreak. There was a 92% reduction on the volume of cars sold during the first two weeks of February 2020.[141]

On 24 February, China's Standing Committee declared an immediate and "comprehensive" ban on its US$74 billion wildlife trade industry, citing the "prominent problem of excessive consumption of wild animals, and the huge hidden dangers to public health and safety" that has been revealed by the outbreak. This permanently extends the temporary ban already in place since the end of January.[142][143]

According to Carbon Brief, the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in China's greenhouse gas emissions being reduced by 25%.[144] In March 2020, satellite images from space provided by NASA revealed that pollution has dropped significantly, which has been attributed in part to the slowdown of economic activity as a result of the outbreak.[145]

As the epidemic accelerated, the mainland market saw a shortage of face masks due to the increased need from the public.[146] It was reported that Shanghai customers had to queue for nearly an hour to buy a pack of face masks which was sold out in another half an hour.[147] Some stores hoarded supplies, driving up prices, so the market regulator cracked down on such acts.[148][149] The shortage will not be relieved until late February, when most workers return from the New Year vacation, according to Lei Limin, an expert in the industry.[150][needs update]

On 22 January 2020, Taobao, China's largest e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba Group, said that all face masks on Taobao and Tmall would not be allowed to increase in price. Special subsidies would be provided to the retailers.

Third-party vendors selling face masks are prohibited from raising prices. Once it is confirmed that the prices of third-party vendors have increased abnormally, JD will immediately remove the offending commodities from shelves and deal with the offending vendors accordingly."[152] Other major e-commerce platforms including Sunning.com and Pinduoduo also promised to keep the prices of health products stable.[153][154]

Hong Kong
Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong

Hong Kong has seen high-profile protests that saw tourist arrivals from mainland China plummet over an eight-month period. The viral epidemic put additional pressure on the travel sector to withstand a prolonged period of downturn.[169] A drop in arrivals from third countries more resilient during the previous months has also been cited as a concern.[134] The city is already in recession[169] and Moody has lowered the city's credit rating.[170][171]

There has also been a renewed increase in protest activity as hostile sentiment against mainland Chinese strengthened over fears of viral transmission from mainland China, with many calling for the border ports to be closed and for all mainland Chinese travellers to be refused entry. Incidents have included a number of petrol bombs being thrown at police stations,[172] a homemade bomb exploding in a toilet,[173] and foreign objects being thrown onto transit rail tracks between Hong Kong and the mainland Chinese border.[174] Political issues raised have included concerns that mainland Chinese may prefer to travel to Hong Kong to seek free medical help (which has since been addressed by the Hong Kong government).[175][176]

Since the outbreak of the virus, a significant number of products have been sold out across the city, including face masks and disinfectant products (such as alcohol and bleach).[177] An ongoing period of panic buying has also caused many stores to be cleared of non-medical products such as bottled water, vegetables and rice.[178] The Government of Hong Kong had its imports of face masks cancelled as global face mask stockpiles decline.[179]

The Mexican Stock Exchange fell to a record low on 10 March due to fears of the coronavirus and because of falling oil prices. The Bank of Mexico (Banxico) stepped in to prop up the value of the peso, which fell 14%.[336] World markets are seeing falls similar to those of 1987.[337]

The Consejo Nacional Empresarial Turístico (National Tourism Business Council, CNET) sent two letters in March to Alfonso Romo, Chief of Staff to the President of Mexico, outlining the importance of tourism to the economy and asking for government support for the sector. Tourism provides 4 million jobs in Mexico, and 93% of the companies have ten or fewer employees. COVID-19 forced the closure of 4,000 hotels (52,400 rooms) and 2,000 restaurants, while the airline industry lost MXN $30 billion (US$1.3 billion) through March.[338] The association of car dealers, ADMA, predicted a decrease in domestic sales between 16% and 25% in 2020.[339]

COVID-19 is expected to subtract US$5.8 billion from Panama's GDP.[340]

Australia is expected to be heavily affected by the epidemic, with early estimations have GDP contracting by 0.2% to 0.5%[341][342] and more than 20,000 Australian jobs being lost.[343] The Australian Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg said that the country would no longer be able to promise a budget surplus due to the outbreak.[344] The Australian dollar dropped to its lowest value since the Great Recession.[345]

The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine called for a calm and a fact-based response to the epidemic, asking people to avoid racism, "panic and division" and the spread of misinformation.[346] A large amount of protective face masks were purchased by foreign and domestic buyers, which has sparked a nationwide face masks shortage.[347] In response to price increases of nearly 2000%, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia has called on these "unethical suppliers" to keep supplies affordable.[347]

Tourism bodies have suggested that the total economic cost to the sector, as of 11 February 2020, would be A$4.5 billion. Casino earnings are expected to fall.[348] At least two localities in Australia, Cairns and the Gold Coast, have reported already lost earnings of more that $600 million.[349] The Australian Tourism Industry Council (ATIC) called on the Government of Australia for financial support especially in light of the large number of small businesses affected.[350]

Mining companies are thought to be highly exposed to the outbreak, since sales to China constitute 93% of the sales of Fortescue Metals, 55% of the sales of BHP, and 45% of the sales of Rio Tinto.[348] The iron ore shipping gauge dropped 99.9% as a result of the outbreak,[351] and the virus has made shipping and logistic operations of mining companies more complicated.[352]

Agriculture is also experiencing negative effects from the outbreak,[353] including the Australian dairy industry,[354] fishing industry,[355] wine producers,[356] and meat producers.[342] On 13 February 2020, Rabobank, which specialises in agricultural banking, warned that the agricultural sector had eight weeks for the coronavirus to be contained before facing major losses.[357] Exports were also affected by the outbreak. In May, China—which is Australia's largest trading partner—stopped accepting Australian meat and placed tariffs on Australian barley, likely a punitive response to Australia's call for an investigation into the origin of the global pandemic.[358]

The education sector is expected to suffer a US$5 billion loss according to an early government estimate,[359][360] including costs due to "tuition fee refunds, free deferral of study, realignment of teaching calendars and student accommodation costs."[361] The taxpayer is likely to be required to cover the shortfall in education budgets.[362] An estimated 100,000 students were not able to enroll at the start of the semester.[363] Nearly two-thirds of Chinese students were forced to remain overseas due to visa restrictions on travellers from mainland China.[364] Salvatore Babones, associate professor at the University of Sydney, stated that "Australia will remain an attractive study destination for Chinese students, but it may take several years for Chinese student numbers to recover".[361]

The Australian Football League (AFL) match between the St Kilda and Port Adelaide Football Clubs, which was scheduled to be played on Sunday, 31 May at Jiangwan Stadium in Shanghai, was transferred to Marvel Stadium in Melbourne due to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic; this match will now be played one week later than planned, on Sunday, 7 June.[365][366]
